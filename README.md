# Full-Stack React Projects / Shama Hoque / 2018

Another Packt Book. ISBN: 978-1-8883-5534

## Prerequisites

Based on one of the early `package.json` in Chapter 2, the code should work with:

 - React 16.3.2
 - MongoDB 3.0.7
 - Express 4.16.3
 - Node 8.1.1

However, since I am reading the book in May 2022, I am using:

 - React 16.14.0
 - MongoDB 3.7.3  # the version reflects the npm library, not the DB
 - Express 4.18.1
 - Node 14.17.6

These changes were made based on `npm audit fix --force`.

I'll try to remember to document what changed from the provided examples.
